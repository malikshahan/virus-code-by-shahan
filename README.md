This Python program uses the Turtle Graphics module to create a colorful spiral pattern. The code starts by positioning the turtle, setting the background to black, and the drawing color to green. With each loop, the turtle moves forward by an increasing distance while turning at an increasing angle, creating a spiral effect.
